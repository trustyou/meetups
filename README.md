Code samples and materials for tech talks and meetups hosted by TrustYou

## [Smart Data Munich](https://www.meetup.com/SmartData/events/237731342/)

Example combining spaCy and Keras for a simple machine learning exercise. See [README.md](smart-data/README.md).

## [PyData Berlin](http://www.meetup.com/PyData-Berlin/events/226240128/)

In this meetup I showed how a pipeline similar to TrustYou's - crawl, analyze, serve - can be built out of popular Python libraries. And then how it can be scaled up.

```
$ cd pydata
$ pip install -r requirements.txt # e.g. in a virtualenv
$ ./run_example.sh
```

The above example will crawl meetup.com to discover all meetups (runs a few hours!), and then build a Word2Vec model based on their descriptions.

## [BigData/DataScience Cluj-Napoca meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Data-Science-Meetup-Cluj-Napoca/events/216156792/)

In this meetup we shared some insights into the TrustYou big data tech stack, and gave introductions to two tools we've found useful: [Apache Pig](http://pig.apache.org/) and [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi). The examples from the slides are contained in this repo.

### Apache Pig

Install Apache Pig, e.g. from their website. No Hadoop necessary! Alternatively, give the Hortonworks sandbox a try if you're planning to try out other Hadoop-related technologies as well. Then, run this:

```
$ cd big-data/pig
$ ./run_examples.sh
```

Look in the *.tsv sub folders for the output - when run locally, Apache Pig mimics the folder structure of job output in the HDFS, so the data will be in part files.

### Luigi

Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` from luigi folder. Then, run:

```
$ cd big-data/luigi
$ ./run_example.sh
```

## [Cluj.py "Extending Python in C" meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Cluj-py/events/218034932/)

We had a look behind the scenes of CPython, the reference implementation of Python, and its C API which allows you to extend the Python language in C. Finally we checked out [Cython](http://cython.org/), which seems to be the sanest way of writing C extensions of Python.

In the examples we focused on benchmarking different implementations of QuickSort in Python, C and Cython. Before trying them, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the python-c folder. I propose to run the following inside a [virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/):

```
$ virtualenv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate 
(venv) $ cd python-c
(venv) $ ./run_examples.sh
```
